What is “Hateoas”?
The acronym HATEOAS stands for "Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State." It is a guiding principle used in the creation of web APIs with the goal of ensuring that these APIs are self-descriptive and capable of being discovered.
Simply put, HATEOAS enables a server to furnish a client with details about the possible actions that can be taken next. Typically, this information is integrated into the API response itself, often in the form of links or other navigational controls. This empowers the client to interact with the API in a dynamic manner without relying on predefined knowledge or hardcoded endpoints.
Security on API
How to put security on a API REST?
1.	Use HTTPS: Encrypt data to protect against interception.
2.	Authentication: Implement robust methods to verify client identity.
3.	Authorization: Control access to API resources based on user roles or attributes.
4.	Input Validation: Validate and sanitize input to prevent injection attacks.
5.	Secure Data Storage: Hash passwords and encrypt sensitive data at rest.
6.	Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse and protect against DoS attacks by limiting requests.
7.	Logging and Monitoring: Monitor API usage and log access for security incidents.
8.	Secure Headers and CORS: Set secure HTTP headers and restrict CORS to prevent common attacks.
9.	API Gateway: Use for additional security features like request validation and traffic management.
10.	Security Testing: Regularly test for vulnerabilities and conduct penetration testing.
